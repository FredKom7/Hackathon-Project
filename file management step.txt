
Prerequisites
Install Firebase in your project:

bash
Copy code
npm install firebase
Set up Firebase Storage and Firestore in the Firebase Console.


File Management Code
Firebase Configuration
Create a firebaseConfig.js file to set up Firebase

How It Works
Upload: The handleUpload function uploads the file to Firebase Storage and saves its metadata (name and URL) in Firestore.
Display: The fetchFiles function retrieves all files from Firestore and displays them in a list.
Delete: The handleDelete function removes the file from both Storage and Firestore.
Update: The handleUpdate function updates the file's metadata (name) in Firestore.
Improvements
Add progress indicators for uploads.
Implement better error handling.
Optimize file retrieval for large datasets (e.g., pagination).
