Prerequisites
Firebase Firestore Setup:

Create a Firestore database in the Firebase Console.
Set up a sessions collection to store user activity data.
Chart.js Setup:

Install Chart.js and React Chart.js 2:
bash
Copy code
npm install chart.js react-chartjs-2

Firebase Configuration
Use the same firebaseConfig.js as in the previous example to initialize Firebase.


How It Works 

Track Session:

The trackSession function stores each user's session details (user ID, login time, usage duration) in Firestore when the user logs in.
usageDuration is simulated here for demonstration.
Fetch Sessions:

The fetchSessions function retrieves session data from Firestore and updates the sessions state.
Display Analytics:

A Line Chart visualizes session data using react-chartjs-2.
A list displays session details such as login time, user ID, and usage duration.
